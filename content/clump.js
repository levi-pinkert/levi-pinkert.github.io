This game placed **40th** out of **5,714** submissions in the GMTK Game Jam 2021, which I am incredibly proud of.
The theme was "Joined Together", so I made a puzzle game where you join blocks together.
People praised its clever puzzle design and unique mechanics.
The game also features a uniquely minimal art style, which not only looks great but enabled me to make the game fully independently in just 2 days.
### How to Play
Use **WASD** or **arrow keys** to move.\n
Press **backspace** to restart a level.\n
Touch all the blue dots to beat a level.\n
