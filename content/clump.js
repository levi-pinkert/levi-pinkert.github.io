This game placed **40th** out of **5,714** submissions in the GMTK Game Jam 2021.
The theme was "Joined Together", so I made a game where you join blocks together to solve puzzles.
I'm proud of its clever puzzle design and unique yet simple mechanics.
The game also features a minimal art style, which not only looks great but enabled me to make the game fully independently in just 2 days.
I built in in Game Maker Studio in just 48 hours.
### How to Play
- Use **WASD** or **arrow keys** to move.
- Press **backspace** to restart a level.
- Touch all the blue dots to beat a level.
