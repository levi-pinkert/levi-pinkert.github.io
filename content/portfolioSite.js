I built this website with React and Next.JS. Hopefully the results speak for themselves!

To show off all of my projects, I built this website.
I used Next.JS, which is essentially React, but with lots of valuable bells and whistles like server-side rendering.
To create all the animations that make the site really pop, I used React Spring.
Then, I hosted the site on GitHub Pages.
I hope you like the result!
