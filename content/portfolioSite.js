I built this website with React and Next.JS. Hopefully the results speak for themselves!

To show off my projects, I built this website.
I used Next.JS, which is essentially React but with some helpful features like server-side rendering.
To create all the animations that make the site really pop, I used a package called React Spring.
Then, I hosted the site on GitHub Pages.
