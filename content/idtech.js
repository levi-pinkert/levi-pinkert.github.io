This summer, I taught coding camps. My students were between the ages of 11 and 17, and the classes had up to 10 students.
I taught 3 different classes:
- JavaScript Coding and Game Creation
- VR Design With Unity and Meta Quest 2
- Game Design and Development 101 with Unreal Engine\n
In total, I taught classes for 8 weeks. During that time, I massively improved my ability to communicate about code, since I taught coding fundamentals to beginners all day every day.\n
I also became much better at handling stressful situations.
The camp had 86 students spread across 11 instructors, so there were always unexpected situations popping up.
To handle those situations, I had to be extremely adaptable, communicative, and reliable.
And, due to the leadership I displayed, I recieved a promotion to "Lead Instructor" partway through the summer.\n
