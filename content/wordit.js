I created this game in a weekend for HackSC 2022.
It's a hyper-casual word game inspired by Wordle, 2048, and Boggle.
I designed and programmed the game in Game Maker Studio, and my teammate [Will Farhat](https://www.willfarhat.com) built a container website.
HackSC is USC's largest hackathon and features four categories: Earth's Environment, Entertainment, Social Impact, and Creator Economy.
We submitted our creation under the working title *Writus* and won the Entertainment category!
Check out the original submission [here](https://www.willfarhat.com/writus).
### Mobile Development
After the game's success at HackSC, we decided to develop a mobile release in our free time.
We brought on Charlie Heatherly to do art and production, found a better name, and planned out some new features:
- Daily objectives
- Skins to let players customize their game's visuals
- A shop for game skins
- An interactive tutorial
- Tons of polish\n
We're making steady progress, and hopefully WordIt will be available on the iOS App Store soon!\n
