I created this game in a weekend for HackSC 2022.
It's a hyper-casual word game inspired by Wordle, 2048, and Boggle.
I designed and programmed the game in Game Maker Studio, and my teammate [Abby Farhat](https://www.willfarhat.com) built a container website.
HackSC is USC's largest hackathon and features four categories: Earth's Environment, Entertainment, Social Impact, and Creator Economy.
We submitted our creation under the working title *Writus* and won the Entertainment category!
Check out the original submission [here](https://www.willfarhat.com/writus).
### Mobile Development
After the game's success at HackSC, we started working on a mobile release in our free time.
Development is on hold for now, but here's a sneak peek at what we developed:\n
