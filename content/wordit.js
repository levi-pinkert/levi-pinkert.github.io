I created this hyper-casual puzzle game, inspired by Wordle, 2048, and Boggle in a weekend for HackSC 2022.
I designed and programmed the game in Game Maker Studio, and my teammate [Will Farhat](https://www.willfarhat.com) built a container website.
HackSC is USC's largest hackathon and features four categories: Earth's Environment, Entertainment, Social Impact, and Creator Economy.
We submitted our creation under the working title Writus and won the Entertainment category!
### Mobile Development
After the game's success at HackSC, we decided to begin developing a mobile release of the game in our free time.
We brought on Charlie Heatherly to do art and production, found a better name, and planned out some new features:
- A super intuitive tutorial
- Daily objectives
- Skins to let players customize their game's visuals
- A shop for game skins
- Tons of polish\n
We're making steady progress, and hopefully WordIt will be available on the iOS App Store soon!\n
