USC's Rocket Propulsion Lab is a club that designs, builds, and launches rockets into space!
In 2019, RPL became the first fully student-run club to launch a rocket past the Karman line.
In the year that I've been involved, we have tested many new motor designs and launched a 6" diameter rocket.
### My Involvement
I'm part of the Production Systems team. We build and maintain services that help the club build the rocket.
These services include Confluence (for documentation), a custom parts ordering website, a PCB inventory website, and more.
In the past, we have had trouble keeping all these websites online consistently, so my first independent project was a website that tracks uptime for all our other websites.
I built the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built the backend with Java and SQL.\n
