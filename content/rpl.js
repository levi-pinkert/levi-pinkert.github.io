USC's Rocket Propulsion Lab is a club that designs, builds, and launches rockets into space!
In 2019, RPL became the first fully student-run club to launch a rocket past the Karman line.
In the last year, while I've been involved, we have done static fires of many different motors and launched one 6" diameter rocket.
### My Involvement
I'm part of the Production Systems team. We build and maintain services that the club build the rocket.
These services include Confluence (for documentation), a custom parts ordering website, a PCB inventory website, and more.
In the past, we have run into issues with keeping all these websites online consistently, so my first independent project a website that tracks uptime for all of our websites.
I built the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built the backend with Java and SQL.\n
