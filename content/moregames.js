Over the last six years, I've done more than 20 game jams!
Here are some other favorites that are worth checking out.
### The Meatball in the Machine
I made this game for USC's April Fools Game Jam 2022 with my friends Charlie Heatherly, Will Farhat, and William McCullen.
The theme was "unhinged", so we made a game that not only involves hinges but is a little off the rails.
I did most of the gameplay programming and level design, which paid off when we won the "Best Design" award.
Play it in browser [here](https://williammccullen.itch.io/the-meatball-in-the-machine).
### Fractured Wasteland
This game was unique because my sister, Ella Pinkert, drew the game's art.
We made the game for GM48 #37 (Jan 2021), with the theme "Falling Apart".
Windows download available [here](https://gm48.net/game/1799/fractured-wasteland).
### Trijam
Trijam is incredibly unique because you only have 3 hours to make a video game.
I love it because it forces me to really focus and do incredibly tight, economical design.
I've made a number of games for Trijam, and some of my favorites (which you can play in the browser) are [Grouper](https://fajpaj.itch.io/grouper) and [atom.ic](https://fajpaj.itch.io/atomic).
